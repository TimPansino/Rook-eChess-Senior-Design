# The Rook-eChess Board
![Alt text](CoverPhoto.jpeg?raw=true)

The Rook-eChess board is a light up chess game board that teaches beginners how to play the game. It allows a person to play against a friend or a beginner AI, while experiencing the advantages of chess software (like displaying legal moves) and the advantages of a physical chess board (like seeing the board in 3D space). When playing in one player mode, the provided AI will allow a beginner to practice using a physical board before taking on a human opponent. In two player mode, the board will not inhibit the usual flow of the game while conveniently coaching the new player.
